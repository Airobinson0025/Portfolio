           Before my transition into the tech world, I was an Emergency Medical Technician for 3 years in downtown Richmond, Virginia. Throughout my time in the healthcare industry I learned skills not just valuable in a job setting but in life itself. Teamwork, critical thinking, but most importantly how to treat a stranger like family. I will take these skills and experiences with me on my journey as a developer and apply them diligently. 

           Developing as a hobby has now grown into a passion of mine. I am eager to build, collaborate, and learn wherever there is opportunity to do so. The ultimate goal is to work on projects that impact the world.</p>
